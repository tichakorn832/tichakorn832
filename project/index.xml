      <title>CAREER: Establishing Correctness of Learning-Enabled Autonomous Systems with Conflicting Requirements (NSF)</title>

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous systems are subject to multiple regulatory requirements due to their safety-critical nature. In general, it is infeasible to guarantee the satisfaction of all requirements under all conditions. In such situations, the system needs to decide how to prioritize among them. Two main factors complicate this decision. First, the priorities among the conflicting requirements may not be fully established. Second, the decision needs to be made under uncertainties arising from both the learning-based components within the system and the unstructured, unpredictable, and non-cooperating nature of the environments. Therefore, establishing the correctness of autonomous systems requires specification languages that capture the unequal importance of the requirements, quantify the violation of each requirement, and incorporate uncertainties faced by the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed effort targets a major gap in theoretical foundations and computational tools to enable practical applications of formal methods throughout the development process of autonomous systems that include learning-based components, operate in uncertain environments, and are subject to conflicting requirements with partially established priorities. Its key novelty lies in the development of (1) probabilistic rulebooks, a new specification formalism that captures the tradeoffs between the uncertainty and the degree of violation of the requirements and utilizes such violation risk together with partially established priorities among the requirements to establish a consistent order among the trajectories of the system, (2) minimum-violation control synthesis algorithms that minimize the total violation risk based on the probabilistic rulebooks and allow learning-based functionality to be incorporated in a provably correct manner, and (3) quantitative verification frameworks that utilize statistical analysis of the learning-based components and the environment as well as the probabilistic rulebooks to provide quantitative analysis of the system. Such development will serve as a critical step towards establishing assurance of autonomous systems. This project will validate the theoretical results and algorithms developed under the proposed effort on a small autonomy platform that will also be utilized for educational purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resource-Aware Hierarchical Runtime Verification for Mixed-Abstraction-Level Systems of Systems (NSF)</title>

&lt;p&gt;Piloting an aircraft is popularly described as hours of abject boredom punctuated by periods of abject terror. Similarly, a spacecraft in transit to a distant target remains largely dormant but for periodic heightened activity required for maintenance and staying on course. Aircraft and spacecraft are complex systems of systems that must seamlessly work together, switching control through a carefully orchestrated hierarchy representing different levels of abstraction, e.g., exemplified by different timescales for events. Each on-board system presents its own verification challenge; verifying that the symphony of all of them playing together at the same time, in the face of potentially unexpected environmental inputs, is particularly daunting. We can supplement design-time verification with efficient runtime verification engines, but they need to grow to be able to reason about the hierarchical nature of complex systems-of-systems, where single requirements may need to encapsulate multiple levels of abstraction. The final result must be able to execute in real time, within system resource constraints. Existing tools for runtime verification aren&amp;rsquo;t capable of obeying constraints imposed by running them on real systems (or in real missions), and don&amp;rsquo;t have parameters to focus their computational demands on the tasks most impactful on system safety. Achieving safe CPS depends on growing the tools and algorithms of real-time verification to integrate realistic safety checks into their control architectures and dynamic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project adapts techniques from formal methods, control theory, hardware-software integration, and software engineering to design runtime monitors that inspect cyber-physical systems of systems without interfering with their normal operation. The project designs, analyzes, and implements fundamental runtime verification techniques by dealing with three general and orthogonal problems: mixed-abstraction-level granularity in specifications, resource-awareness to ensure non-intrusiveness of runtime monitors, and augmenting monitors with model-prediction to enable on-deadline mitigation triggering. Key innovations stem from this rigorous foundation in establishing a new formal semantics for hierarchical, mixed-abstraction-level specification, and evaluating formal specifications without interfering with the system&amp;rsquo;s normal operation, while maximizing utilization of resources within realistic constraints of embedded CPS. The project generalizes the new theory into specification patterns for hierarchical functional requirements and synthesize predictive models to enable better, more automated creation of runtime verification configurations to meet scalability demands of modern CPS. Flight tests of small aircraft swarms are used to validate this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planning with Conflicting Specifications</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/planning-conflicting-specifications/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous systems may be subject to several requirements. Consider, as an example, autonomous vehicles that need to follow the road rules. Often, these rules cannot be simultaneously satisfied. For instance, when encoutering a vehicle that is (improperly) parked next to the solid line, an autonomous vehicle may need to violate the lane keeping rule (which prohibits the vehicle from crossing solid lane boundary) or the obstacle clearance rule (which requires the vehicle to keep some safety gap when passing a parked vehicle). Another example is the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;trolley problem&lt;/a&gt; where autonomous systems need to choose which safety requirements to violate. More complications arise when taking into account uncertainties, e.g., in perception, prediction, control, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to develop planning and decision-making algorithms for systems that are subject to multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. These objectives may be represented by a combination of cost functions (e.g., control efforts) and temporal logic formulas (e.g., rules of the road), with associated violation metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Formal Specifications of Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/formal-specifications/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/formal-specifications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A specification for a system describes its admissible behaviors and formalizes its properties. Many existing design and verification efforts, particularly those based on formal methods, assume the availability of such specifications. However, this assumption has been proved to be a major problem of its own, as witnessed in many CPS applications that integrate autonomy. The lack of precise specifications is a significant impediment towards formal methods realizing their full potential in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to provide theory, methods, and tools to derive, analyze, and refine specifications for systems subject to regulatory requirements. Our approach integrates formal methods, learning-based approaches, and game-theoretic frameworks, and utilize complementary sources of information, namely the textual information from the regulatory requirements and the demonstrations, taking into account their imperfection such as ambiguity, incompleteness, labeling errors, and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autonomy in Mobility-on-Demand Systems</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/mobility-on-demand/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/mobility-on-demand/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the use of private vehicles starts approaching its limits to effectively meet the demand for personal mobility in densely populated cities, mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems emerge as a more economical and sustainable alternative. These systems rely on the deployment of a fleet of vehicles at different stations that are distributed throughout the city. The customers simply have to walk to a station near their origin, pick up a vehicle, drive it to the station near to their destination and drop it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to assess and demonstrate the role of autonomy in mobility-on-demand systems through modeling, algorithm development and experimental demonstration. We have instrumented a golf cart and demonstrated basic autonomous driving capabilities, including reliable navigation in a GPS-denied environment and safe interaction with automotive and pedestrian traffic. Unlike most existing autonomous vehicles, our golf cart uses minimal sensing and off-the-shelf components to attain the same level of operational ability while keeping the system economically viable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traffic congestion causes significant efficiency losses, wasteful energy consumption and excessive air pollution. This problem arises in many urban areas because of the continual growth in motorization and the difficulties in increasing road capacity due to space limitations and budget constraints. As a result, traffic management that aims at maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of road networks without increasing road capacity becomes increasingly crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project focuses on mechanism design for dynamic pricing and real-time control of traffic signals based on control, communication, optimization and game theory in order to manage traffic flows in an optimal manner and minimize traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Temporal Logic Planning (TuLiP) Toolbox</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/tulip/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/tulip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Temporal Logic Planning (TuLiP) Toolbox is a Python-based software toolbox for the synthesis of embedded control software that is provably correct with respect to an expressive subset of linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. TuLiP combines routines for (1) finite state abstraction of control systems, (2) digital design synthesis from LTL specifications, and (3) receding horizon planning. The underlying digital design synthesis routine treats the environment as adversary; hence, the resulting controller is guaranteed to be correct for any admissible environment profile. TuLiP applies the receding horizon framework, allowing the synthesis problem to be broken into a set of smaller problems, and consequently alleviating the computational complexity of the synthesis procedure, while preserving the correctness guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Consensus Approaches to the Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/consensus/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/consensus/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The assignment problem, also regarded as the bipartite Maximum Weighted Matching problem, is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization and provides several applications, especially in the areas of multi-agent coordination, distributed computing and distributed manufacturing. In particular, it has been shown that optimal task and resource allocation can be reduced to an instance of the assignment problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work aims at designing a consensus protocol to solve the assignment problem in a completely distributed manner without any central management or global knowledge. The main application of this work is sensor dispatch, an emerging problem in wireless sensor networks where a subset of mobile sensors need to decide how to move in order to optimize certain global objectives while maintaining the coverage ability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Formal Methods for Design and Verification of Embedded Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/formal-methods/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The design of reliable embedded control systems inherits the difficulties involved in designing both control systems and distributed (concurrent) computing systems. Design bugs in these systems may arise from the unforeseen interactions among the computing, communication and control subsystems. Motivated by the difficulties of finding this type of design bugs, this project focuses on developing mathematical frameworks, based on formal methods, to facilitate the design and analysis of such embedded systems. This work incorporates methodology from computer science and control, including model checking, theorem proving, synthesis of digital designs, reachability analysis, Lyapunov-type methods and receding horizon control. Various applications have been considered, including autonomy, vehicle management and multi-target tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/planning-systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This work introduces an encapsulation approach to path planning for multi-vehicle control that permits other decision processes to work with simple, spatially-abstracted domain models, and partially or wholly ignore obstacles, observation uncertainty and vehicle dynamics. Application to multi-vehicle command and control has been considered.&lt;/p&gt;
