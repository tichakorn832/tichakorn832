&lt;p&gt;As autonomous systems start to operate in open, uncontrolled environments alongside humans, safety becomes a major concern. In applications in which human-operated systems and autonomous systems are in close interaction, the heterogeneity causes different agents to exhibit different behaviors under the same situation due to the differences in how they see the world and make decisions. For example, autonomous vehicles tend to be more conservative than average human drivers, leading to instances of confusion and frustration of human drivers when encountering an autonomous vehicle. As a result, understanding the effects of inconsistencies among interacting agents on the overall system is critical for the adoption and acceptance of autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to develop novel algorithms that will quantitatively and succinctly characterize the sources and effects of inconsistencies in perception and decision-making among the interacting agents. Based on this characterization, the project will develop efficient synthesis algorithms for autonomous systems to actively identify the inconsistencies and influence the behaviors of the other agents to improve the safety of the overall system. A key innovation lies in a rigorous approach integrating probabilistic formal methods, games on graphs, joint perception and planning, and convex optimization. While the resulting algorithms will be applicable to a wide range of cyber-physical systems, demonstrations will leverage an experimental platform in which autonomous vehicles interact with each other as well as human-controlled vehicles in mockup urban environments. The project will likewise promote outreach to industry, regulatory agencies, and the broader cyber-physical system (CPS) community through technical short courses. All educational material, demonstrations and software generated by the project will be shared publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CAREER: Establishing Correctness of Learning-Enabled Autonomous Systems with Conflicting Requirements (NSF)</title>

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous systems are subject to multiple regulatory requirements due to their safety-critical nature. In general, it is infeasible to guarantee the satisfaction of all requirements under all conditions. In such situations, the system needs to decide how to prioritize among them. Two main factors complicate this decision. First, the priorities among the conflicting requirements may not be fully established. Second, the decision needs to be made under uncertainties arising from both the learning-based components within the system and the unstructured, unpredictable, and non-cooperating nature of the environments. Therefore, establishing the correctness of autonomous systems requires specification languages that capture the unequal importance of the requirements, quantify the violation of each requirement, and incorporate uncertainties faced by the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed effort targets a major gap in theoretical foundations and computational tools to enable practical applications of formal methods throughout the development process of autonomous systems that include learning-based components, operate in uncertain environments, and are subject to conflicting requirements with partially established priorities. Its key novelty lies in the development of (1) probabilistic rulebooks, a new specification formalism that captures the tradeoffs between the uncertainty and the degree of violation of the requirements and utilizes such violation risk together with partially established priorities among the requirements to establish a consistent order among the trajectories of the system, (2) minimum-violation control synthesis algorithms that minimize the total violation risk based on the probabilistic rulebooks and allow learning-based functionality to be incorporated in a provably correct manner, and (3) quantitative verification frameworks that utilize statistical analysis of the learning-based components and the environment as well as the probabilistic rulebooks to provide quantitative analysis of the system. Such development will serve as a critical step towards establishing assurance of autonomous systems. This project will validate the theoretical results and algorithms developed under the proposed effort on a small autonomy platform that will also be utilized for educational purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piloting an aircraft is popularly described as hours of abject boredom punctuated by periods of abject terror. Similarly, a spacecraft in transit to a distant target remains largely dormant but for periodic heightened activity required for maintenance and staying on course. Aircraft and spacecraft are complex systems of systems that must seamlessly work together, switching control through a carefully orchestrated hierarchy representing different levels of abstraction, e.g., exemplified by different timescales for events. Each on-board system presents its own verification challenge; verifying that the symphony of all of them playing together at the same time, in the face of potentially unexpected environmental inputs, is particularly daunting. We can supplement design-time verification with efficient runtime verification engines, but they need to grow to be able to reason about the hierarchical nature of complex systems-of-systems, where single requirements may need to encapsulate multiple levels of abstraction. The final result must be able to execute in real time, within system resource constraints. Existing tools for runtime verification aren&amp;rsquo;t capable of obeying constraints imposed by running them on real systems (or in real missions), and don&amp;rsquo;t have parameters to focus their computational demands on the tasks most impactful on system safety. Achieving safe CPS depends on growing the tools and algorithms of real-time verification to integrate realistic safety checks into their control architectures and dynamic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project adapts techniques from formal methods, control theory, hardware-software integration, and software engineering to design runtime monitors that inspect cyber-physical systems of systems without interfering with their normal operation. The project designs, analyzes, and implements fundamental runtime verification techniques by dealing with three general and orthogonal problems: mixed-abstraction-level granularity in specifications, resource-awareness to ensure non-intrusiveness of runtime monitors, and augmenting monitors with model-prediction to enable on-deadline mitigation triggering. Key innovations stem from this rigorous foundation in establishing a new formal semantics for hierarchical, mixed-abstraction-level specification, and evaluating formal specifications without interfering with the system&amp;rsquo;s normal operation, while maximizing utilization of resources within realistic constraints of embedded CPS. The project generalizes the new theory into specification patterns for hierarchical functional requirements and synthesize predictive models to enable better, more automated creation of runtime verification configurations to meet scalability demands of modern CPS. Flight tests of small aircraft swarms are used to validate this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Journey of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/post/av-journey/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 12:24:09 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tichakorn832.github.io/post/av-journey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This post is based on my own opinion, which is not necessarily representative of the opinion of my previous and current employers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!---
The history of autonomous vehicles dates back to at least the 1920s when Houdina Radio Control demonstrated a radio-controlled car driving through the streets of New York City.
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of Grand Challenges organized by DARPA in March 2004, October 2005, and November 2007 marked a major milestone in the history of autonomous vehicles as it attracted significant research attention and spurred rapid progress in this field.
The first two challenges featured a race of autonomous vehicles through a desert with dirt roads, cliffs, ditches, boulders, underpasses, open water, etc., as shown in the video below.
The vehicles were required to stay within a corridor specified in the &lt;a href=&#39;https://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/RDDF_Document.pdf&#39;&gt;RDDF (Route Data Definition File)&lt;/a&gt;, which was distributed to the teams 2 hours before the race, and contained a list of waypoint coordinates together with the associated corridor widths and speed limits.
The corridor was not guaranteed to be obstacle-free.
Thus, the vehicles had to be able to find a &amp;ldquo;road&amp;rdquo; (i.e., drivable, reasonably flat surface) and avoid obstacles, which were mostly static, with the exception of other autonomous vehicles competing in the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/S4Ud7nYRwwQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The third race of the series, the DARPA Urban Challenge, shifted the focus to an urban environment, requiring the vehicles to execute a series of mock military supply missions while obeying California traffic laws, including lane keeping, merging, passing, negotiating intersections, making U-turns, parking, and avoiding obstacles.
As in the previous two races, the vehicles were fully autonomous.
No humans were allowed inside the vehicles.
Any communication to and from the vehicles was also prohibited.
The only possible intervention was through a &lt;a href=&#39;https://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/Estop_Guidance.pdf&#39;&gt;wireless emergency stop safety system (E-stop)&lt;/a&gt;, which was operated by DARPA to pause or completely disable the vehicle in case of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The development timeframe:&lt;/strong&gt;
The Urban Challenge was announced in May 2006.
The teams had to go through the qualification process, including the site visit (June&amp;ndash;July 2007) and the National Qualification Event (NQE, 26&amp;ndash;31 October 2007) before proceeding to the Urban Challenge Final Event (UFE, 3 November 2007).
This gave each team about 1 year to implement the &lt;em&gt;Basic Navigation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Basic Traffic&lt;/em&gt; functionalities required for the site visit as described in the &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.grandchallenge.org/grandchallenge/docs/Technical_Evaluation_Criteria_031607.pdf&#39;&gt;Technical Evaluation Criteria&lt;/a&gt;, after which the team had about 6 more months to implement the advanced functionalities required for both the NQE and the UFE such as navigating obstacle fields, parking lots, and partially blocked intersections, handling road blockages, merging into moving traffic, and performing an evasive maneuver by pulling to the side to avoid head-on collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The race:&lt;/strong&gt; The specific location (George Air Force Base, Victorville, CA) of the NQE and UFE was kept secret until August 2007, less than 3 months before the NQE.
Furthermore, the teams did not have access to the site, so it was not possible to build a prior, HD map that most autonomous vehicles these days rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DARPA used two file formats to describe a mission: &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.grandchallenge.org/grandchallenge/docs/RNDF_MDF_Formats_031407.pdf&#39;&gt;the Route Network Definition File (RNDF) and the Mission Data File (MDF)&lt;/a&gt;.
The RNDF was basically a digital street map, which specified accessible road segments and free-travel zones &lt;!--- (i.e., areas within which the vehicles can move freely) --&gt;
and provided information such as waypoints, checkpoints, parking spots, stop signs, lane widths, lane boundaries, connections between lanes, zone boundaries, and entry and exit points to each zone.
Although the RNDF was reasonably accurate, it had 3 key limitations.
First, even though the waypoints were guaranteed to be within their associated lanes, a straight line connecting them might go off road.
Second, connectivity of waypoints was not guaranteed as the road could be completely or partially blocked.
Finally, part of the zones might not be drivable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MDF specified the sequence of checkpoints to be visited by the vehicle as well as the minimum and maximum speed limits for each segment in the RNDF.
The mission length and complexity varied in different runs.
In particular, the UFE was split into 3 missions, covering the total of approximately 60 miles, and consisting of interactions with both human-driven vehicles and other autonomous vehicles.
The objective of the vehicles was to complete the missions as quickly as possible while satisfying all the rules specified in the &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.grandchallenge.org/grandchallenge/docs/Technical_Evaluation_Criteria_031607.pdf&#39;&gt;Technical Evaluation Criteria&lt;/a&gt;.
Any infraction of the rules could lead to time penalties or disqualification.
(However, as far as I know, the specific penalty for each violation was not provided before the race.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the RNDF was provided at least 24 hours in advance, the MDF was given to the team right before each run.
After receiving the MDF, the team had only 5 minutes to load it and get the vehicle ready in autonomous mode to begin the run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video below was taken from a camera mounted on Team Caltech&amp;rsquo;s vehicle, Alice, during one of the tests in the NQE and illustrated the maneuvers required by the &lt;em&gt;Basic Navigation&lt;/em&gt; functionality.
In fact, around the 34th second, Alice was paused as it was heading towards a concrete barrier.
DARPA then asked the team whether to let her continue the mission, a decision that was very difficult to make without any access to the vehicle&amp;mdash;we did not even know whether the sensors or the computers were still running.
We decided to take the risk, and Alice successfully completed the mission with quite a bit of difficulty to satisfy the obstacle clearance requirement due to her size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Key technological development:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#39;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2010.0110&#39;&gt;The article by Campbell et al.&lt;/a&gt; provides a very good description of approaches and challenges faced by different teams (Cornell, Georgia Tech, MIT, and Caltech).
In summary, most vehicles consisted of 4 main components: sensing, perception (+ localization), planning, and control.
The key sensors included GPS, IMU, odometry, lidar, radar, and cameras.
The perception component used the measurements from these sensors to localize the vehicle within the map, detect and track objects and relevant features (e.g., road, lane marking, stop lines, etc.), and create a representation of the world around the vehicle.
The planning component used this information to compute a trajectory (path + speed) for the vehicle to follow.
Finally, the control component sent actuation commands (brake, throttle, steering, gear shifting) to keep the vehicle on the trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 18-month timeframe was quite short for any new technological development, especially as many teams consisted mainly of students, who also had to worry about classes and exams.
So, the effort was mainly directed towards putting together and extending existing approaches, rather than inventing radically new ones. &lt;!--- (This is quite an over-simplistic statement as it still took a lot of effort to figure out how to get things to work robustly together.) --&gt;
Perhaps, a key exception to this statement was the Velodyne’s HDL-64E sensor, which was used by 5 out of the 6 vehicles that finished the race, and was an essential technology emerging from the Challenge.
This spinning lidar and its successors, including the more affordable models with 16 and 32 beams and the high-end models with 128 beams, became a key component of many autonomous vehicles nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the architectures and algorithms of the perception subsystem varied greatly among different teams, a more common structure was observed in the planning and control subsystems.
In particular, the planning subsystem was typically decomposed into 3 levels&amp;mdash;the mission planner, the behavioral planner, and the trajectory planner&amp;mdash;although the name and detail of responsibilities and algorithms used in each level varied.
Roughly, the mission planner computed a high-level route for the vehicle to complete the mission.
The behavioral planner was responsible for making local decisions (e.g., whether to stay in lane, proceed through an intersection, etc.) and typically implemented as a finite-state machine.
The trajectory planner then translated the decision into a trajectory for the vehicle to follow, using variations of optimization-based (e.g., MPC) and graph-based (e.g., RRT, PRM) approaches. &lt;!--- with graphs constructed based on variations of RRT and PRM algorithms or directly from RNDF --&gt;
Most vehicles employed different trajectory planners for different driving situations.
Finally, the controller was typically based on pure pursuit and PID.
More details about planning and control algorithms can be found in &lt;a href=&#39;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07446.pdf&#39;&gt;the article by Paden et al.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major technological challenges:&lt;/strong&gt;
The Urban Challenge expanded the scientific community&amp;rsquo;s exposure to the complexity of designing safety-critical autonomous systems.
Not only the challenges associated with individual components (perception, planning, control, contingency management, etc.)
but also their integration needed to be addressed.
In particular, subtle design bugs may arise from the unforeseen interactions among different components
and manifest as undesirable behavior only under a very specific set of conditions,
making them very hard to catch using simulation and testing.
For example, consider the following components, which were implemented on Alice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the path planner, which generated a path for Alice to follow,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the safety system, which rapidly decelerated the vehicle when it deviated too much from the planned path and got too close to an obstacle, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the low-level steering controller, which limited the steering rate at low speeds to protect the vehicle steering system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these functionalities seemed reasonable by itself.
However, when combined together, they led to an unsafe behavior under a very specific circumstance where
Alice had to make a tight turn while merging into traffic,
with a concrete barrier next to the major road.
In this case, the planned path contained a sharp turn.
Accelerating from a low speed, the controller was unable to execute the turn closely due to the limited steering rate.
As a result, Alice deviated from the path and headed towards the concrete barrier; the safety system activated and slowed it down, leading to an even stricter limit on the steering rate.
This cycle continued, causing Alice to be stuck at the corner of a sharp turn,
dangerously stuttering in the middle of an intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I think the key technical challenges evolved around the following factors:
uncertainties, complex tasks, and interconnection of computing, communication, and physical components.
The uncertain and unstructured nature of environments led to an unreasonably large number of test scenarios and drove the question of edge cases.
The complex interaction of different components caused any change in one component to potentially affect the others in an unexpected way.
Finally, complex tasks were primarily handled by handcrafted finite state machines,
which ended up hosting several hacks to handle corner cases encountered during testing.
In particular, Alice&amp;rsquo;s behavioral planner was initially implemented as a finite state machine with less than 5 states,
but it quickly turned into 3 interacting finite state machines, each containing more than 20 states,
making it almost impossible to analyze or debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AV industry, key enablers, and challenges:&lt;/strong&gt;
Google pioneered the AV industry with the Google X&amp;rsquo;s Project Chauffeur (now Waymo) in 2009.
Several years later, many startups were founded, including Cruise (founded in 2013, acquired by GM in 2016), nuTonomy (founded in 2013, acquired by Aptiv in 2017), Zoox (founded in 2014, acquired by Amazon in 2020), Drive.ai (founded in 2015, acquired by Apple in 2019), Argo AI (founded in 2016), Pony.ai (founded in 2016), and Aurora (founded in 2017), just to name a few.
&lt;a href=&#39;https://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/self-driving/surprise-2020-is-not-the-year-for-selfdriving-cars&#39;&gt;Early predictions&lt;/a&gt; indicated that autonomous vehicles would be ready to roam the streets in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype of the industry was primarily driven by several technological advances that were not sufficiently mature at the time of the Urban Challenge&amp;mdash;the most notable one being deep learning, which has become a core part of most state-of-the-art object classification and intent prediction algorithms.
Some companies went further and adopted end-to-end learning that directly maps raw sensor data to vehicle actuation commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other relevant technologies include &lt;a href=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping&#39;&gt;SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping)&lt;/a&gt;,
which is often used to generate a pre-built map and enables accurate map-based localization.
Advances in optimization-based control, particularly &lt;a href=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control&#39;&gt;model predictive control (MPC)&lt;/a&gt;,
allow real-time computation of control signals with complex nonlinear cost functions.
New planning algorithms such as &lt;a href=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree&#39;&gt;RRT*&lt;/a&gt; provide asymptotic optimality guarantee.
Finally, &lt;a href=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods&#39;&gt;formal methods&lt;/a&gt; eliminate the need of handcrafted finite state machines and enable complex tasks to be handled in a provably correct way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the aforementioned algorithms have been implemented in open-source software such as
&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.tensorflow.org/&#39;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#39;https://pytorch.org/&#39;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.ros.org/&#39;&gt;ROS&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#39;https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/&#39;&gt;OMPL&lt;/a&gt;.
In fact, one can build an autonomous vehicle out of open-source software,
and it might already handle most of the &amp;ldquo;nominal&amp;rdquo; scenarios.
These technological advances greatly simplify the initial phase of building autonomous vehicles,
making the estimate of their arrival to market overly optimistic.
(Recall that it took a team of mostly students only a year to make a vehicle drive itself
for the DARPA Urban Challenge when most of these technologies and open-source software did not even exist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the number of off-nominal cases, as well as their complexity, may have been underappreciated.
Additionally, in many situations, it is not even clear how the vehicle should behave as there are no
&lt;a href=&#39;https://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/docs/Technical_Evaluation_Criteria_031607.pdf&#39;&gt;precisely defined rules as in the DARPA Urban Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&#39;https://trid.trb.org/view/1727480&#39;&gt;article from MIT task force&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjWraHgz-frAhWFcc0KHWxKCBwQFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fouravfuture.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F08%2FWotF-2020-Research-Brief-Leonard-Mindell-Stayton.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2JXuYPKeoGd7uCEC7gfyhE&#39;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) predicts that deployment of fully automated driving systems that have no safety driver onboard will take at least a decade. Additionally, expansion will likely be gradual and will happen region-by-region in specific categories of transportation, resulting in wide variations in availability across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel extremely privileged to be a part of this exciting journey from its early days.
Autonomous vehicles, and more generally autonomous systems, will remain an active area of research and new ideas will be needed to bring this journey through the last mile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planning with Conflicting Specifications</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/planning-conflicting-specifications/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/planning-conflicting-specifications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous systems may be subject to several requirements. Consider, as an example, autonomous vehicles that need to follow the road rules. Often, these rules cannot be simultaneously satisfied. For instance, when encoutering a vehicle that is (improperly) parked next to the solid line, an autonomous vehicle may need to violate the lane keeping rule (which prohibits the vehicle from crossing solid lane boundary) or the obstacle clearance rule (which requires the vehicle to keep some safety gap when passing a parked vehicle). Another example is the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;trolley problem&lt;/a&gt; where autonomous systems need to choose which safety requirements to violate. More complications arise when taking into account uncertainties, e.g., in perception, prediction, control, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to develop planning and decision-making algorithms for systems that are subject to multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. These objectives may be represented by a combination of cost functions (e.g., control efforts) and temporal logic formulas (e.g., rules of the road), with associated violation metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Formal Specifications of Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/formal-specifications/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/formal-specifications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A specification for a system describes its admissible behaviors and formalizes its properties. Many existing design and verification efforts, particularly those based on formal methods, assume the availability of such specifications. However, this assumption has been proved to be a major problem of its own, as witnessed in many CPS applications that integrate autonomy. The lack of precise specifications is a significant impediment towards formal methods realizing their full potential in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to provide theory, methods, and tools to derive, analyze, and refine specifications for systems subject to regulatory requirements. Our approach integrates formal methods, learning-based approaches, and game-theoretic frameworks, and utilize complementary sources of information, namely the textual information from the regulatory requirements and the demonstrations, taking into account their imperfection such as ambiguity, incompleteness, labeling errors, and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autonomy in Mobility-on-Demand Systems</title>
      <link>https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/mobility-on-demand/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the use of private vehicles starts approaching its limits to effectively meet the demand for personal mobility in densely populated cities, mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems emerge as a more economical and sustainable alternative. These systems rely on the deployment of a fleet of vehicles at different stations that are distributed throughout the city. The customers simply have to walk to a station near their origin, pick up a vehicle, drive it to the station near to their destination and drop it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to assess and demonstrate the role of autonomy in mobility-on-demand systems through modeling, algorithm development and experimental demonstration. We have instrumented a golf cart and demonstrated basic autonomous driving capabilities, including reliable navigation in a GPS-denied environment and safe interaction with automotive and pedestrian traffic. Unlike most existing autonomous vehicles, our golf cart uses minimal sensing and off-the-shelf components to attain the same level of operational ability while keeping the system economically viable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traffic congestion causes significant efficiency losses, wasteful energy consumption and excessive air pollution. This problem arises in many urban areas because of the continual growth in motorization and the difficulties in increasing road capacity due to space limitations and budget constraints. As a result, traffic management that aims at maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of road networks without increasing road capacity becomes increasingly crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project focuses on mechanism design for dynamic pricing and real-time control of traffic signals based on control, communication, optimization and game theory in order to manage traffic flows in an optimal manner and minimize traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Temporal Logic Planning (TuLiP) Toolbox</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Temporal Logic Planning (TuLiP) Toolbox is a Python-based software toolbox for the synthesis of embedded control software that is provably correct with respect to an expressive subset of linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. TuLiP combines routines for (1) finite state abstraction of control systems, (2) digital design synthesis from LTL specifications, and (3) receding horizon planning. The underlying digital design synthesis routine treats the environment as adversary; hence, the resulting controller is guaranteed to be correct for any admissible environment profile. TuLiP applies the receding horizon framework, allowing the synthesis problem to be broken into a set of smaller problems, and consequently alleviating the computational complexity of the synthesis procedure, while preserving the correctness guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The assignment problem, also regarded as the bipartite Maximum Weighted Matching problem, is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization and provides several applications, especially in the areas of multi-agent coordination, distributed computing and distributed manufacturing. In particular, it has been shown that optimal task and resource allocation can be reduced to an instance of the assignment problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work aims at designing a consensus protocol to solve the assignment problem in a completely distributed manner without any central management or global knowledge. The main application of this work is sensor dispatch, an emerging problem in wireless sensor networks where a subset of mobile sensors need to decide how to move in order to optimize certain global objectives while maintaining the coverage ability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The design of reliable embedded control systems inherits the difficulties involved in designing both control systems and distributed (concurrent) computing systems. Design bugs in these systems may arise from the unforeseen interactions among the computing, communication and control subsystems. Motivated by the difficulties of finding this type of design bugs, this project focuses on developing mathematical frameworks, based on formal methods, to facilitate the design and analysis of such embedded systems. This work incorporates methodology from computer science and control, including model checking, theorem proving, synthesis of digital designs, reachability analysis, Lyapunov-type methods and receding horizon control. Various applications have been considered, including autonomy, vehicle management and multi-target tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project involves building an autonomous ground vehicle capable of maneuvering a 60 mile course in a mock urban environment in less than 6 hours. As the coordinator of the Systems team, my contribution to this project is the development of a new software architecture for distributed goal and contingency management which is the main part of the mission management subsystem. I have also implemented the decision making logic of the planning module.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Abstraction-Based Multi-Vehicle Command and Control</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This work introduces an encapsulation approach to path planning for multi-vehicle control that permits other decision processes to work with simple, spatially-abstracted domain models, and partially or wholly ignore obstacles, observation uncertainty and vehicle dynamics. Application to multi-vehicle command and control has been considered.&lt;/p&gt;
