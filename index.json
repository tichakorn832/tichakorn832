In general, it is infeasible to guarantee the satisfaction of all requirements under all conditions. In such situations, the system needs to decide how to prioritize among them. Two main factors complicate this decision. First, the priorities among the conflicting requirements may not be fully established. Second, the decision needs to be made under uncertainties arising from both the learning-based components within the system and the unstructured, unpredictable, and non-cooperating nature of the environments. Therefore, establishing the correctness of autonomous systems requires specification languages that capture the unequal importance of the requirements, quantify the violation of each requirement, and incorporate uncertainties faced by the systems.\nThe proposed effort targets a major gap in theoretical foundations and computational tools to enable practical applications of formal methods throughout the development process of autonomous systems that include learning-based components, operate in uncertain environments, and are subject to conflicting requirements with partially established priorities. Its key novelty lies in the development of (1) probabilistic rulebooks, a new specification formalism that captures the tradeoffs between the uncertainty and the degree of violation of the requirements and utilizes such violation risk together with partially established priorities among the requirements to establish a consistent order among the trajectories of the system, (2) minimum-violation control synthesis algorithms that minimize the total violation risk based on the probabilistic rulebooks and allow learning-based functionality to be incorporated in a provably correct manner, and (3) quantitative verification frameworks that utilize statistical analysis of the learning-based components and the environment as well as the probabilistic rulebooks to provide quantitative analysis of the system. Such development will serve as a critical step towards establishing assurance of autonomous systems. This project will validate the theoretical results and algorithms developed under the proposed effort on a small autonomy platform that will also be utilized for educational purposes.\n","date":1644883200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644883200,"objectID":"be1f986db6817026a1cb275d9274063f","permalink":"https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/correctness-autonomy/","publishdate":"2022-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/correctness-autonomy/","section":"project","summary":"Develop specification formalisms, control synthesis algorithms, and quantitative verification frameworks for autonomous systems that include learning-based components, operate in uncertain environments, and are subject to conflicting requirements with partially established priorities.","tags":["Autonomy","Formal methods","Specifications","Motion planning","Current projects"],"title":"CAREER: Establishing Correctness of Learning-Enabled Autonomous Systems with Conflicting Requirements (NSF)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hamad Ullah","Weisi Fan","Tichakorn Wongpiromsarn"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654224594,"objectID":"0387a0d5175c1c1dd9e7b70bfb500681","permalink":"https://tichakorn832.github.io/publication/ullah-2022-design/","publishdate":"2022-06-03T02:49:54.934745Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ullah-2022-design/","section":"publication","summary":" Object classification is a key element that enables effective decision-making in many autonomous systems.

The heavily regulated, safety critical nature of aviation may lead to multiple, competing safety constraints. In this paper, we design a framework which allows for the scalable planning of a UAM ATM system. We formalize safety oriented constraints derived from FAA regulations by encoding them as temporal logic formulae.

Similarly, a spacecraft in transit to a distant target remains largely dormant but for periodic heightened activity required for maintenance and staying on course. Aircraft and spacecraft are complex systems of systems that must seamlessly work together, switching control through a carefully orchestrated hierarchy representing different levels of abstraction, e.g., exemplified by different timescales for events. Each on-board system presents its own verification challenge; verifying that the symphony of all of them playing together at the same time, in the face of potentially unexpected environmental inputs, is particularly daunting. We can supplement design-time verification with efficient runtime verification engines, but they need to grow to be able to reason about the hierarchical nature of complex systems-of-systems, where single requirements may need to encapsulate multiple levels of abstraction. The final result must be able to execute in real time, within system resource constraints. Existing tools for runtime verification aren\u0026rsquo;t capable of obeying constraints imposed by running them on real systems (or in real missions), and don\u0026rsquo;t have parameters to focus their computational demands on the tasks most impactful on system safety. Achieving safe CPS depends on growing the tools and algorithms of real-time verification to integrate realistic safety checks into their control architectures and dynamic environments.\nThis project adapts techniques from formal methods, control theory, hardware-software integration, and software engineering to design runtime monitors that inspect cyber-physical systems of systems without interfering with their normal operation. The project designs, analyzes, and implements fundamental runtime verification techniques by dealing with three general and orthogonal problems: mixed-abstraction-level granularity in specifications, resource-awareness to ensure non-intrusiveness of runtime monitors, and augmenting monitors with model-prediction to enable on-deadline mitigation triggering. Key innovations stem from this rigorous foundation in establishing a new formal semantics for hierarchical, mixed-abstraction-level specification, and evaluating formal specifications without interfering with the system\u0026rsquo;s normal operation, while maximizing utilization of resources within realistic constraints of embedded CPS. The project generalizes the new theory into specification patterns for hierarchical functional requirements and synthesize predictive models to enable better, more automated creation of runtime verification configurations to meet scalability demands of modern CPS. Flight tests of small aircraft swarms are used to validate this approach.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"e98bfc3e30448538f1dedbdccde361dd","permalink":"https://tichakorn832.github.io/project/runtime-verification/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/runtime-verification/","section":"project","summary":"Develop runtime verification techniques that incorporate mixed-abstraction-level granularity in specifications and enable on-deadline mitigation triggering","tags":["Formal methods","Runtime verification","Current projects"],"title":"Resource-Aware Hierarchical Runtime Verification for Mixed-Abstraction-Level Systems of Systems (NSF)","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604070000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604070000,"objectID":"7acc08a172e9ba3cfbac598b07589a22","permalink":"https://tichakorn832.github.io/talk/2020-galcit/","publishdate":"2020-10-23T16:22:42-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-galcit/","section":"talk","summary":" This talk provides an overview of practical applications of formal methods in the design of autonomous systems that are subject to complex rules.

The first two challenges featured a race of autonomous vehicles through a desert with dirt roads, cliffs, ditches, boulders, underpasses, open water, etc., as shown in the video below. The vehicles were required to stay within a corridor specified in the RDDF (Route Data Definition File), which was distributed to the teams 2 hours before the race, and contained a list of waypoint coordinates together with the associated corridor widths and speed limits. The corridor was not guaranteed to be obstacle-free. Thus, the vehicles had to be able to find a \u0026ldquo;road\u0026rdquo; (i.e., drivable, reasonably flat surface) and avoid obstacles, which were mostly static, with the exception of other autonomous vehicles competing in the race.\n  \nThe third race of the series, the DARPA Urban Challenge, shifted the focus to an urban environment, requiring the vehicles to execute a series of mock military supply missions while obeying California traffic laws, including lane keeping, merging, passing, negotiating intersections, making U-turns, parking, and avoiding obstacles. As in the previous two races, the vehicles were fully autonomous. No humans were allowed inside the vehicles. Any communication to and from the vehicles was also prohibited. The only possible intervention was through a wireless emergency stop safety system (E-stop), which was operated by DARPA to pause or completely disable the vehicle in case of emergency.\nThe development timeframe: The Urban Challenge was announced in May 2006. The teams had to go through the qualification process, including the site visit (June\u0026ndash;July 2007) and the National Qualification Event (NQE, 26\u0026ndash;31 October 2007) before proceeding to the Urban Challenge Final Event (UFE, 3 November 2007). This gave each team about 1 year to implement the Basic Navigation and Basic Traffic functionalities required for the site visit as described in the Technical Evaluation Criteria, after which the team had about 6 more months to implement the advanced functionalities required for both the NQE and the UFE such as navigating obstacle fields, parking lots, and partially blocked intersections, handling road blockages, merging into moving traffic, and performing an evasive maneuver by pulling to the side to avoid head-on collisions.\nThe race: The specific location (George Air Force Base, Victorville, CA) of the NQE and UFE was kept secret until August 2007, less than 3 months before the NQE. Furthermore, the teams did not have access to the site, so it was not possible to build a prior, HD map that most autonomous vehicles these days rely on.\nDARPA used two file formats to describe a mission: the Route Network Definition File (RNDF) and the Mission Data File (MDF). The RNDF was basically a digital street map, which specified accessible road segments and free-travel zones and provided information such as waypoints, checkpoints, parking spots, stop signs, lane widths, lane boundaries, connections between lanes, zone boundaries, and entry and exit points to each zone. Although the RNDF was reasonably accurate, it had 3 key limitations. First, even though the waypoints were guaranteed to be within their associated lanes, a straight line connecting them might go off road. Second, connectivity of waypoints was not guaranteed as the road could be completely or partially blocked. Finally, part of the zones might not be drivable.\nThe MDF specified the sequence of checkpoints to be visited by the vehicle as well as the minimum and maximum speed limits for each segment in the RNDF. The mission length and complexity varied in different runs. In particular, the UFE was split into 3 missions, covering the total of approximately 60 miles, and consisting of interactions with both human-driven vehicles and other autonomous vehicles. The objective of the vehicles was to complete the missions as quickly as possible while satisfying all the rules specified in the Technical Evaluation Criteria. Any infraction of the rules could lead to time penalties or disqualification. (However, as far as I know, the specific penalty for each violation was not provided before the race.)\nWhile the RNDF was provided at least 24 hours in advance, the MDF was given to the team right before each run. After receiving the MDF, the team had only 5 minutes to load it and get the vehicle ready in autonomous mode to begin the run.\nThe video below was taken from a camera mounted on Team Caltech\u0026rsquo;s vehicle, Alice, during one of the tests in the NQE and illustrated the maneuvers required by the Basic Navigation functionality. In fact, around the 34th second, Alice was paused as it was heading towards a concrete barrier. DARPA then asked the team whether to let her continue the mission, a decision that was very difficult to make without any access to the vehicle\u0026mdash;we did not even know whether the sensors or the computers were still running. We decided to take the risk, and Alice successfully completed the mission with quite a bit of difficulty to satisfy the obstacle clearance requirement due to her size.\n  \nKey technological development: The article by Campbell et al. provides a very good description of approaches and challenges faced by different teams (Cornell, Georgia Tech, MIT, and Caltech). In summary, most vehicles consisted of 4 main components: sensing, perception (+ localization), planning, and control. The key sensors included GPS, IMU, odometry, lidar, radar, and cameras. The perception component used the measurements from these sensors to localize the vehicle within the map, detect and track objects and relevant features (e.g., road, lane marking, stop lines, etc.), and create a representation of the world around the vehicle. The planning component used this information to compute a trajectory (path + speed) for the vehicle to follow. Finally, the control component sent actuation commands (brake, throttle, steering, gear shifting) to keep the vehicle on the trajectory.\nThe 18-month timeframe was quite short for any new technological development, especially as many teams consisted mainly of students, who also had to worry about classes and exams. So, the effort was mainly directed towards putting together and extending existing approaches, rather than inventing radically new ones. Perhaps, a key exception to this statement was the Velodyne’s HDL-64E sensor, which was used by 5 out of the 6 vehicles that finished the race, and was an essential technology emerging from the Challenge. This spinning lidar and its successors, including the more affordable models with 16 and 32 beams and the high-end models with 128 beams, became a key component of many autonomous vehicles nowadays.\nWhile the architectures and algorithms of the perception subsystem varied greatly among different teams, a more common structure was observed in the planning and control subsystems. In particular, the planning subsystem was typically decomposed into 3 levels\u0026mdash;the mission planner, the behavioral planner, and the trajectory planner\u0026mdash;although the name and detail of responsibilities and algorithms used in each level varied. Roughly, the mission planner computed a high-level route for the vehicle to complete the mission. The behavioral planner was responsible for making local decisions (e.g., whether to stay in lane, proceed through an intersection, etc.) and typically implemented as a finite-state machine. The trajectory planner then translated the decision into a trajectory for the vehicle to follow, using variations of optimization-based (e.g., MPC) and graph-based (e.g., RRT, PRM) approaches. Most vehicles employed different trajectory planners for different driving situations. Finally, the controller was typically based on pure pursuit and PID. More details about planning and control algorithms can be found in the article by Paden et al.\nMajor technological challenges: The Urban Challenge expanded the scientific community\u0026rsquo;s exposure to the complexity of designing safety-critical autonomous systems. Not only the challenges associated with individual components (perception, planning, control, contingency management, etc.) but also their integration needed to be addressed. In particular, subtle design bugs may arise from the unforeseen interactions among different components and manifest as undesirable behavior only under a very specific set of conditions, making them very hard to catch using simulation and testing. For example, consider the following components, which were implemented on Alice:\n the path planner, which generated a path for Alice to follow, the safety system, which rapidly decelerated the vehicle when it deviated too much from the planned path and got too close to an obstacle, and the low-level steering controller, which limited the steering rate at low speeds to protect the vehicle steering system.  Each of these functionalities seemed reasonable by itself. However, when combined together, they led to an unsafe behavior under a very specific circumstance where Alice had to make a tight turn while merging into traffic, with a concrete barrier next to the major road. In this case, the planned path contained a sharp turn. Accelerating from a low speed, the controller was unable to execute the turn closely due to the limited steering rate. As a result, Alice deviated from the path and headed towards the concrete barrier; the safety system activated and slowed it down, leading to an even stricter limit on the steering rate. This cycle continued, causing Alice to be stuck at the corner of a sharp turn, dangerously stuttering in the middle of an intersection.\nIn short, I think the key technical challenges evolved around the following factors: uncertainties, complex tasks, and interconnection of computing, communication, and physical components. The uncertain and unstructured nature of environments led to an unreasonably large number of test scenarios and drove the question of edge cases. The complex interaction of different components caused any change in one component to potentially affect the others in an unexpected way. Finally, complex tasks were primarily handled by handcrafted finite state machines, which ended up hosting several hacks to handle corner cases encountered during testing. In particular, Alice\u0026rsquo;s behavioral planner was initially implemented as a finite state machine with less than 5 states, but it quickly turned into 3 interacting finite state machines, each containing more than 20 states, making it almost impossible to analyze or debug.\nAV industry, key enablers, and challenges: Google pioneered the AV industry with the Google X\u0026rsquo;s Project Chauffeur (now Waymo) in 2009. Several years later, many startups were founded, including Cruise (founded in 2013, acquired by GM in 2016), nuTonomy (founded in 2013, acquired by Aptiv in 2017), Zoox (founded in 2014, acquired by Amazon in 2020), Drive.ai (founded in 2015, acquired by Apple in 2019), Argo AI (founded in 2016), Pony.ai (founded in 2016), and Aurora (founded in 2017), just to name a few. Early predictions indicated that autonomous vehicles would be ready to roam the streets in 2020.\nThe hype of the industry was primarily driven by several technological advances that were not sufficiently mature at the time of the Urban Challenge\u0026mdash;the most notable one being deep learning, which has become a core part of most state-of-the-art object classification and intent prediction algorithms. Some companies went further and adopted end-to-end learning that directly maps raw sensor data to vehicle actuation commands.\nOther relevant technologies include SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping), which is often used to generate a pre-built map and enables accurate map-based localization. Advances in optimization-based control, particularly model predictive control (MPC), allow real-time computation of control signals with complex nonlinear cost functions. New planning algorithms such as RRT* provide asymptotic optimality guarantee. Finally, formal methods eliminate the need of handcrafted finite state machines and enable complex tasks to be handled in a provably correct way.\nMany of the aforementioned algorithms have been implemented in open-source software such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, ROS, and OMPL. In fact, one can build an autonomous vehicle out of open-source software, and it might already handle most of the \u0026ldquo;nominal\u0026rdquo; scenarios. These technological advances greatly simplify the initial phase of building autonomous vehicles, making the estimate of their arrival to market overly optimistic. (Recall that it took a team of mostly students only a year to make a vehicle drive itself for the DARPA Urban Challenge when most of these technologies and open-source software did not even exist.)\nUnfortunately, the number of off-nominal cases, as well as their complexity, may have been underappreciated. Additionally, in many situations, it is not even clear how the vehicle should behave as there are no precisely defined rules as in the DARPA Urban Challenge.\nAn article from MIT task force (pdf) predicts that deployment of fully automated driving systems that have no safety driver onboard will take at least a decade. Additionally, expansion will likely be gradual and will happen region-by-region in specific categories of transportation, resulting in wide variations in availability across the country.\nI feel extremely privileged to be a part of this exciting journey from its early days. Autonomous vehicles, and more generally autonomous systems, will remain an active area of research and new ideas will be needed to bring this journey through the last mile.\n","date":1595179449,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595179449,"objectID":"8a264bf7a60a650d79923be814744c4b","permalink":"https://tichakorn832.github.io/post/av-journey/","publishdate":"2020-07-19T12:24:09-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/av-journey/","section":"post","summary":"A summary of technological progress and challenges over the past 10+ years.","tags":[],"title":"The Journey of Autonomous Vehicles","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  May 27: I\u0026rsquo;m giving a talk on Establishing Correctness of Learning-Enabled Autonomous Systems at Workshop on Safe and Reliable Robot Autonomy under Uncertainty, ICRA 2022.\n May 11: Hamad Ullah successfully defended his Master\u0026rsquo;s thesis!.\n May 5: Opening ceremony of the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at 1110 Communications Building.\n Oct 30: I\u0026rsquo;m giving talk on Formal Methods for Control Synthesis of Autonomous Systems at the GALCIT Colloquium at Caltech.\n Oct 23: I\u0026rsquo;m giving talk on Formal Methods for Control Synthesis of Autonomous Systems at the Robotics Engineering Colloquium Series at WPI.\n Sep 24: Our paper on Minimum-Violation Planning for Autonomous Systems: Theoretical and Practical Considerations is available on arxiv.\n May 20: Our paper on Hierarchical Multiobjective Shortest Path Problems is available online on WAFR 2020.\n Apr 20: I\u0026rsquo;m giving guest lectures on Minimum Violation Planning and on Rulebooks for the Autonomous Racing course at University of Pennsylvania.\n Mar 20: I\u0026rsquo;m giving a talk on Behavior Specifications of Autonomous Vehicles at Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.\n Mar 20: Richard Murray and I are teaching a short course on Specification, Design, and Verification for Self-Driving Cars at Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey.

It is an idealistic assumption for our application since vehicles (going straight, turning left/right) are all gathered in the same lane apart from the proximity of the intersection and cameras can only give estimations of the aggregated queue length. In this paper, we present a back-pressure traffic signal controller (BP) that does not require routing rates, it requires only aggregated queue lengths estimation (without direction information) and loop detectors at the stop line for each possible direction. A theoretical result on the Lyapunov drift in heavy load conditions under BP control is provided and tends to indicate that BP should have good stability properties.

They provide a natural framework for road pricing design, since each motorist may myopically optimize his or her own utility as a function of road price and collectively communicate with his or her friends and neighbors on traffic situation at the same time. This paper considers the road pricing design by using game theory and consensus theory. For the case where a system supervisor broadcasts information on the overall system to each agent, we present a variant of standard fictitious play called average strategy fictitious play (ASFP) for large-scale repeated congestion games. Only a weighted running average of all other players' actions is assumed to be available to each player. The ASFP reduces the burden of both information gathering and information processing for each player. Compared to the joint strategy fictitious play (JSFP) studied in the literature, the updating process of utility functions for each player is avoided. We prove that there exists at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the congestion game under investigation, and the players' actions generated by the ASFP with inertia (players' reluctance to change their previous actions) converge to a Nash equilibrium almost surely. For the case without broadcasting, a consensus protocol is introduced for individual agents to estimate the percentage of players choosing each resource, and the convergence property of players' action profile is still ensured. The results are applied to road pricing design to achieve socially local optimal trip timing.

Compared to joint strategy fictitious play (JSFP) studied in the literature, the updating process of utility functions for each player is avoided.

The proposed control structure consists of a goal generator, a trajectory planner, and a continuous controller. The goal generator reduces the trajectory generation problem into a sequence of smaller problems of short horizon while preserving the desired system-level temporal properties. Subsequently, in each iteration, the trajectory planner solves the corresponding short-horizon problem with the currently observed state as the initial state and generates a feasible trajectory to be implemented by the continuous controller. Based on the simulation property, we show that the composition of the goal generator, trajectory planner and continuous controller and the corresponding receding horizon framework guarantee the correctness of the system with respect to its specification regardless of the environment in which the system operates. In addition, we present a response mechanism to handle failures that may occur due to a mismatch between the actual system and its model. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through an example of an autonomous vehicle navigating an urban environment.

Design bugs in these systems may arise from the unforeseen interactions among the computing, communication and control subsystems. Motivated by the difficulties of finding this type of design bugs, this thesis develops mathematical frameworks, based on formal methods, to facilitate the design and analysis of such embedded systems. An expressive specification language of linear temporal logic (LTL) is used to specify the desired system properties. The practicality of the proposed frameworks is demonstrated through autonomous vehicle case studies and autonomous urban driving problems. Our approach incorporates methodology from computer science and control, including model checking, theorem proving, synthesis of digital designs, reachability analysis, Lyapunov-type methods and receding horizon control. This thesis consists of two complementary parts, namely, verification and design. First, we introduce Periodically Controlled Hybrid Automata (PCHA), a subclass of hybrid automata that abstractly captures a common design pattern in embedded control systems. New sufficient conditions that exploit the structure of PCHAs in order to simplify their invariant verification are presented. Although the aforementioned technique simplifies an invariant verification of PCHAs, finding a proper invariant remains a challenging problem. To complement the verification efforts, in the second part of the thesis, we present a methodology for automatic synthesis of embedded control software that provides a formal guarantee of system correctness, with respect to its desired properties expressed in linear temporal logic. The correctness of the system is guaranteed even in the presence of an adversary (typically arising from changes in the environments), disturbances and modeling errors. A receding horizon framework is proposed to alleviate the associated computational complexity of LTL synthesis. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through the autonomous urban driving problems.","tags":[],"title":"Formal Methods for Design and Verification of Embedded Control Systems: Application to an Autonomous Vehicle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tichakorn Wongpiromsarn","Keyou You","Lihua Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"0685eec5aac85a0e9d5d13f62bac0cab","permalink":"https://tichakorn832.github.io/publication/wongpiromsarn-2010-consensus/","publishdate":"2020-06-29T03:28:52.987418Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wongpiromsarn-2010-consensus/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a consensus protocol to solve the assignment problem in a completely distributed manner without any central management or global knowledge.

Subsequently, in each iteration, the trajectory planner solves the corresponding short-horizon problem with the currently observed state as the initial state and generates a feasible trajectory to be implemented by the continuous controller. Based on the simulation property, we show that the composition of the goal generator, trajectory planner and continuous controller and the corresponding receding horizon framework guarantee the correctness of the system.
