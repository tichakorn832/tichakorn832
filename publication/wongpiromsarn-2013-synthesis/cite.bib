 abstract = {This article provides a review of control protocol synthesis techniques that incorporate methodologies from formal methods andcontrol  theory  to  provide  correctness  guarantee  for  different  types  of  autonomous  systems,  including  those  with  discrete  andcontinuous  state  space.  The  correctness  of  the  system  is  defined  with  respect  to  a  given  specification  expressed  as  a  formula  inlinear temporal logic to precisely describe the desired properties of the system. The formalism presented in this article admits non-determinism, allowing uncertainties in the system to be captured. A particular emphasis is on alleviating some of the difficulties,e.g., heterogeneity in the underlying dynamics and computational complexity, that naturally arise in the construction of controlprotocols for autonomous systems.},
