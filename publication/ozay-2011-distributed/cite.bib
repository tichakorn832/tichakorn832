 abstract = {We considered the problem of designing control protocols for pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras within a smart camera network where the goal is to guarantee certain temporal logic specifications related to a given surveillance task. We first present a centralized control architecture for assigning PTZ cameras to targets so that the specification is met for any admissible behavior of the targets. Then, in order to alleviate the computational complexity associated with LTL synthesis and to enable implementation of local control protocols on individual PTZ cameras, we propose a distributed synthesis methodology. The main idea is to decompose the global specification into local specifications for each PTZ camera. These decompositions allow the protocols for each camera to be separately synthesized and locally implemented while guaranteeing the global specifications to hold. A thorough design example is presented to illustrate the steps of the proposed procedure.},
