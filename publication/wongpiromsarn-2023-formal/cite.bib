abstract = {Formal methods refer to rigorous, mathematical approaches
to system development and have played a key role in establishing
the correctness of safety-critical systems. The main
building blocks of formal methods are models and specifications,
which are analogous to behaviors and requirements in
system design and give us the means to verify and synthesize
system behaviors with formal guarantees.This monograph provides a survey of the current state of the
art on applications of formal methods in the autonomous
systems domain. We consider correct-by-construction synthesis
under various formulations, including closed systems,
reactive, and probabilistic settings. Beyond synthesizing systems
in known environments, we address the concept of
uncertainty and bound the behavior of systems that employ
learning using formal methods. Further, we examine the synthesis
of systems with monitoring, a mitigation technique
for ensuring that once a system deviates from expected behavior,
it knows a way of returning to normalcy. We also
show how to overcome some limitations of formal methods
themselves with learning. We conclude with future directions
for formal methods in reinforcement learning, uncertainty,
privacy, explainability of formal methods, and regulation
and certification.},
