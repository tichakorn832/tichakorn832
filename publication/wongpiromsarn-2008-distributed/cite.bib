 abstract = {We present an approach that allows mission and contingency management to be achieved in a distributed and dynamic manner without any central control over multiple software modules. This approach comprises two key elements---a mission management subsystem and a Canonical Software Architecture (CSA) for a planning subsystem. The mission management subsystem works in conjunction with the planning subsystem to dynamically replan in reaction to contingencies. The CSA ensures the consistency of the states of all the software modules in the planning subsystem. System faults are identified and replanning strategies are performed distributedly in the planning and the mission management subsystems through the CSA. The approach has been implemented and tested on Alice, an autonomous vehicle developed by the California Institute of Technology for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. },
