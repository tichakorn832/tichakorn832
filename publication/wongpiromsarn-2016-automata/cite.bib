 abstract = {We consider temporal logic verification of (possibly nonlinear) dynamical systems evolving over continuous state spaces. Our approach combines automata-based verification and the use of so-called barrier certificates. Automata-based verification allows the decomposition the verification task into a finite collection of simpler constraints over the continuous state space. The satisfaction of these constraints in turn can be (potentially conservatively) proved by appropriately constructed barrier certificates. As a result, our approach, together with optimization-based search for barrier certificates, allows computational verification of dynamical systems against temporal logic properties while avoiding explicit abstractions of the dynamics as commonly done in literature.},
