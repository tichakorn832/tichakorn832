 abstract = {In this paper we describe an autonomous vehicle that aims at providing shared transportation services in a mobility on demand context. As the service is limited to a known urban environment, prior knowledge of the environment can be exploited, as well as existing infrastructure sensors such as security cameras. We argue that utilizing infrastructure sensors yields greater safety of operation and allows reduction in the number of sensors required on-board, hereby reducing the cost of the vehicle. We describe the role that infrastructure sensors can play and show the resulting improved performances of the system, supported by simulation and field experiment results.},
