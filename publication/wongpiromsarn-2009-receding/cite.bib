 abstract = {This paper bridges the advances in computer science and control to allow automatic synthesis of control strategies for complex dynamical systems which are guaranteed, by construction, to satisfy the desired properties even in the presence of adversary. The desired properties are expressed in the language of temporal logic. With its expressive power, a wider class of properties than safety and stability can be specified. The resulting system consists of a discrete planner that plans, in the abstracted discrete domain, a set of transitions of the system to ensure the correct behaviors and a continuous controller that continuously implements the plan. To address the computational difficulties in the synthesis of a discrete planner, we present a receding horizon based scheme for executing finite state automata that essentially reduces the synthesis problem to a set of smaller problems.},
