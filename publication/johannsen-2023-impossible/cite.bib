 abstract = {We take another look at intractable temporal logic specifications, where the intractability stems from self-reference, unboundedness, or the need for explicit counting. A classic example is the specification, ``Every file that gets opened eventually gets closed.'' In all cases, we show that we can capitalize on realistic constraints implied by the operating environment to generate Mission-time Linear Temporal Logic (MLTL) encodings with reasonably-sized memory signatures. We derive a new set of rewriting rules for MLTL, accompanied by proofs of correctness for each rule, and memory optimizations. We utilize these in creating MLTL encodings for all three patterns of ``intractability,'' proving correctness, time complexity, and space complexity for each type of specification encoding.
