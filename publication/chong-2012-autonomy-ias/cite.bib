 abstract = {We describe the development of our autonomous personal vehicle that attempts to provide mobility on demand service to address the first- and last-mile problem. We discuss the challenges faced for such a system in a campus environment and discuss our approach towards mitigating them. The autonomous vehicle has operated over 30km of autonomous operation in a campus environment interacting with pedestrian and human driven vehicles.},
