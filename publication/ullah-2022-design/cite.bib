 abstract = { Object classification is a key element that enables effective decision-making in many autonomous systems. A more sophisticated system may also utilize the probability distribution over the classes instead of basing its decision only on the most likely class. This paper introduces a new performance metric for evaluating the accuracy of such probabilities. We test this metric using different neural network architectures and datasets. Furthermore, we present a new task-based neural network for object classification and compare its performance with a typical probabilistic classification model to show the improvement with threshold-based probabilistic decision-making.},
