  abstract={This paper proposes two new metrics to evaluate learned object detection models that can be leveraged for quantitative system-level analysis via probabilistic model-checking. We define proposition-labeled and distance-parametrized confusion matrices and show that these matrices can be used to compute the probability of the closed-loop system satisfying its system-level specifications expressed in temporal logic. Instead of using object class labels, the proposition-labeled confusion matrix uses atomic propositions relevant to the high-level planning strategy. Furthermore, unlike the traditional confusion matrix, the proposed distance-parametrized confusion matrix accounts for variations in detection performance with respect to the distance between the ego and the object. We empirically show that these evaluation metrics chosen with the context of i) system-level specifications and ii) the planning module lead to a less conservative analysis in comparison to canonical metrics that do not take these into account. We demonstrate this framework on a car-pedestrian example by computing the satisfaction probabilities for safety requirements formalized in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).},
