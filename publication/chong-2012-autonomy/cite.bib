 abstract = {We present an autonomous vehicle providing mobility-on-demand service in a crowded urban environment. The focus in developing the vehicle has been to attain autonomous driving with minimal sensing and low cost, off-the-shelf sensors to ensure the system's economic viability. The autonomous vehicle has successfully completed over 50 km handling numerous mobility requests during the course of multiple demonstrations. The video provides an overview of our approach, with special comments on our localization and perception modules showcasing one such request being serviced.},
