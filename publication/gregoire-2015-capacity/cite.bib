 abstract = {The control of a network of signalized intersections is considered. Previous work demonstrates that the so-called backpressure control provides stability guarantees, assuming infinite queues capacities. In this paper, we highlight the failing current of backpressure control under finite capacities by identifying sources of nonwork conservation and congestion propagation. We propose the use of a normalized pressure which guarantees work conservation and mitigates congestion propagation, while ensuring fairness at low traffic densities, and recovering original backpressure as capacities grow to infinity. This capacity-aware backpressure control enables improving performance as congestion increases, as indicated by simulation results, and keeps the key benefits of backpressure: the ability to be distributed over intersections and O(1) complexity.},
