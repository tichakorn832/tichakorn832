      <description>&lt;p&gt;The assignment problem, also regarded as the bipartite Maximum Weighted Matching problem, is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization and provides several applications, especially in the areas of multi-agent coordination, distributed computing and distributed manufacturing. In particular, it has been shown that optimal task and resource allocation can be reduced to an instance of the assignment problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work aims at designing a consensus protocol to solve the assignment problem in a completely distributed manner without any central management or global knowledge. The main application of this work is sensor dispatch, an emerging problem in wireless sensor networks where a subset of mobile sensors need to decide how to move in order to optimize certain global objectives while maintaining the coverage ability.&lt;/p&gt;
